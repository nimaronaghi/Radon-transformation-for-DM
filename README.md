# Radon Transformation for DM

This repository provides tools for analyzing 3D velocity data using histograms and the Radon transform for feature extraction. 
It supports converting data into astronomical coordinates and creating a Mollweide sky map.

## Features
- 3D data processing with Radon transformation.
- Astronomical coordinate conversion.
- Visualization with Mollweide projections.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   - Open `rt.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code.

## Example

**Note:** The data used in this project cannot be provided, as it originates from a University of Alberta project and is subject to institutional restrictions.

Input: [Description of input data structure]

Output: [Example of the Mollweide sky map or transformed data]
